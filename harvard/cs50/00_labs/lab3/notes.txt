Selection Sort
- Upper: n^2
- Lower: n^2

Bubble Sort
- Upper: n^2
- Lower: n

Merge Sort
- Upper: n log(n)
- Lower: n log(n)


Upper Bounds
- Merge Sort < Selection Sort = Bubble Sort

Lower Bounds
- Bubble Sort < Merge Sort < Selection Sort


To Tell Difference:
- Bubble sort should be fastest on an already sorted list
- Selection and Merge sort should take the same amount of time regardless of list order
    - Merge sort should be faster than Selection sort
- Merge sort should be faster than Selection and Bubble sort on an unsorted list
